# **A. Lotus in Thạnh Lợi Commune (Tháp Mười District, Đồng Tháp)**

## **1\. History and Transition:** 

* **Initial challenges:** The area was originally characterized by acid sulfate soil and challenging living conditions, including limited fresh water access (with only one shared pond for drinking and household use).  
* **Early settlement:**  
  * Early attempts to settle the area by people from Bến Tre were largely unsuccessful (due to the soil conditions), and they eventually left.  
  * Around 1986: Mr. Men’s uncles arrived as production group leaders, later bringing relatives along (1990-1996). These individuals came from Zone 6 in Hưng Thạnh Commune.  
* **Land reclamation:** Most land was reclaimed by residents around 1975-1980 after clearing out melaleuca forests.  
* **Adoption of lotus cultivation:**  
  * Mr. An was the first to grow lotus in Thanh Loi commune following an instructor from Hưng Thạnh commune. Mr. Liem (his brother) then followed.  
  * As of early 2025: Mr. An had been growing lotus for 4 years, and Mr. Liem for 3 years.  
  * Lotus growers are primarily relatives.

![][image1]

*The area within the red “circle” is under one protected dyke system, about 90% of lotus cultivation in Thanh Loi commune today is under this zone \- the zone covers around 145 ha of land \- plot map is available.* 

## **2\. System Overview:**

* **Crop rotation:** Rice and lotus are rotated, with farmers noting the potential for 3 lotus crops annually, similar to 3 rice crops.  
* **Main lotus area:** Lotus is primarily grown within the dyke protection “Diện” zone (1100-1200 ha) in Thanh Loi commune, which has stable water and less acid sulfate soil.  
  * The 145-hectare dyke area where Mr. An and Mr. Liem farm is important; water quality in and outside the dyke is generally similar, unlike the more acidic water land outside the dyke in Hung Thanh Commune.  
* **Water regulation:** private pumping stations manage water.  
* **Land ownership:** some farmers have both lotus and rice land, while others consider converting melaleuca land to lotus.  
* **Socio-economic contexts:**  
  * **Ethnic Minorities:** A small number of Cham people reside in the area, engaging in rice farming on small landholdings and facing economic difficulties.      
  * **Youth Participation:** Few young people (under 35\) are primarily engaged in agriculture but are more open to modern techniques.  
  * **Female Participation:** Lotus farming practices are shared between men and women, with fertilizing and spraying pesticides (supervision) under men while harvesting and selling under women's decision. Further observation is needed. Participation in training is also predominantly men. 

## **3\. Cultivation Practices:**

* **Lotus:**  
  * *Planting:* Starts from seeds or seedlings (1 month), then grows for 4 months until harvestable.      
  * *Care:* fertilization and pesticide spraying is handled by the farmers (costing about 1 million VND/1000m2/crop).  Continuous care is needed.      
  * *Harvesting:* Manual, labor-intensive (5-6 people/day for 2 ha, 5 AM to 10-11 AM), spanning 40 days/crop, often rotational.  Labor costs are about 200,000 VND/person/day; total costs are about 2 million VND/cong/crop.      
  * *Yield:* Approximately 400-500 kg of fresh lotus seed pods/1000m2/crop.      
* **Rice:** Cultivation is primarily mechanized, with some farmers like Mr. Tu using a mix of organic and chemical fertilizers, despite preferring organic methods for cost reduction.  
* **Technology use:**   
  * Drones are used for spraying pesticides, spreading fertilizer (for both crops), and sowing rice.      
  * Some farmers (like Mr. Cuong and Mr. Tai) own drones and offer spraying services.      
  * Access to machinery like drones varies; wealthier farmers are more likely to own it.  
* **Risks:** Lotus is susceptible to herbicide drift from rice fields, especially with drone spraying; even the "scent" of herbicides can damage lotus pods.  
* **Cultivation standards:** Lotus farming uses both organic and conventional methods (50/50), favoring biological pesticides.  However, there are no specific cultivation standards or certifications (like VietGAP or OCOP) for lotus farming itself, only for the commercial product.   

## **4\. Sales and Market Access:**

* **Primary Product:** The main product is fresh lotus seed pods.  
* **Sales Channels:** Sales are primarily to local traders (from Hưng Thạnh, Mỹ Quý); some traders may sell to Hanoi (unconfirmed). Familiar and trusted traders are often the go-to option (only 1-2 traders in the area, coming from Hung Thanh).  
* **Transaction Method:** Selling occurs in bulk ("cân xô") with immediate cash payment ("tiền trao cháo múc"). Farmers prefer this method for its speed and simplicity.  
* **Price Fluctuation:**  
  * Selling price (2024): 35,000 \- 85,000 VND/kg (average: 45,000 VND/kg).  
  * Price in April 2025: 10,000 VND/kg. Current prices are barely profitable, contrasting with previous peak prices.  
* **Price Negotiation and Storage:** Farmers individually negotiate prices, which fluctuate daily, and have limited bargaining power. Lotus is not easily stored, so it is mainly dried for powder or sold to traders quickly.  
* **Trader Dynamics:** Only one or two main lotus traders operate in the area, reportedly from Hung Thanh. Farmers tend to use familiar, trusted traders.  
* **Challenges with Company Buyers:**  
  * Dai Viet company buys lotus in Hưng Thạnh but has strict requirements and slow payment, making farmers hesitant.  
  * Previous collaborations with Sen Dai Viet and Ha Long Cannery failed due to diseases and contract issues.  
* **Company Operations:**  
  * Sen Dai Viet's model of growing lotus on rented land failed due to crop disease, leading to insufficient supply and contract breaches. The company's office in Hung Thanh is closed, though the company is still developing its facility elsewhere.  
* **By-product Sales:** Some sales of lotus leaves/flowers to a company in Zone 6 at 10,000-15,000 VND/kg occur, but profits are low due to labor costs.  
* **Income Patterns:**  
  * Farmers like Mr. Liem earn substantial income from lotus (e.g., 400-500 million VND/year after costs from 6 hectares), plus income from drone services.  
  * Rice generates lower income per hectare but is less risky.  
  * Lotus income is highly dependent on price, making it vulnerable; current low prices are barely profitable.  
* **Alternative Income**: Some residents engage in wage labor; larger landowners may rent out machinery \- like drones.

## **5\. Cooperation, Training and Information Access**

* **Agricultural Training:** The provincial Agricultural Service Center and District Department of Agriculture conduct training sessions (twice in 2024\) on lotus cultivation. Attendance is mainly by lotus farmers, typically male.  
* **Farmer-Led Information Seeking:** Farmers also seek information from other farmers and agricultural supply stores, even in other provinces, showing a 50/50 split between official programs and farmer-to-farmer knowledge.  
  * **Kinship Networks:** Family and kinship are important in joining and maintaining the lotus farming model.  
  * **Cooperation for Risk Mitigation:** Cooperation among related households helps mitigate risks like pesticide drift.  
* **Key Farmer Practices:** Mr. An actively seeks information, even traveling to learn from experts in other regions.  
* **Information Channels:** A Zalo channel is used for exchanges mainly used by established farmers.  
* **Agricultural Groups:** There's an organic-focused lotus "group" at Mr. An's house, with one main focus on access to credit, but past cooperative attempts have dwindled; farmers mainly exchange information informally.

## **6\. Challenges and Opportunities:**

* **Challenges:**  
* Risk from pesticides from other fields.  
* "Chay day" disease: The "chay day" (could be *Phytophthora* or *Fusarium*) disease recently (re)appeared (2024-2025), damaging lotus plants and prompting farmers like Mr. Liem to consider switching back to rice if no remedy is found.  
* **Reduction of pod’s price** (see more in section about Sales)  
* Need for constant care.  
* Labor-intensive harvesting.  
* Decreasing expertise in lotus cultivation in Hưng Thạnh.  
* **Opportunities:**  
  * **Economic Potential:** Lotus is more profitable than rice, attracting farmers. There's potential for area expansion.  
  * **Future plans:** The commune is planning to allocate land for lotus and seek company investment. A Long An-based company is scheduled to discuss lotus purchasins  
  * **Strategies \- Market Engagement:** In April 2025, a meeting was arranged between a lotus purchasing company and farmers to discuss contracts.  The company proposed buying silk lotus at 120,000 VND/kg (produced from 3kg of fresh lotus). Training will be conducted for farmers to learn how to process lotus.      
  * **Shift Towards Sustainability:** Farmers are gradually trying to adopt more organic practices, reducing chemical fertilizer and pesticide use from 80-90% to 60-40% or 70-30% over the past three years.  This shift is linked to the **One Million Hectare Rice Project**, a government initiative promoting efficient rice cultivation, which has been adopted in the Thap Muoi district due to its effectiveness and cost reduction.  


# **B. Mango in Bình Hàng Tây Commune (Cao Lãnh District, Đồng Tháp)**

## **1\. History and Transition:**

* This area has a history of rice cultivation dating back before 1975\.  
* The transition to mango cultivation occurred gradually.  
* Some mango orchards are older than the others, considered "mango trees left by ancestors" ("xoài ông cha để lại"), possibly planted around the 2000s.

## **2\. System Overview:**

* The common model is mango monoculture or combining young mango with other crops.      
* Intercropping with papaya is practiced in young mango plots.   
* Mango is the main crop locally, with many (500+ out of 750+) households engaged in cultivation, averaging less than 1 hectare per household.      
* Local farmers highly value the natural conditions of Cao Lanh, Dong Thap, considering it "the best land, no storms, no saltwater intrusion, the most comfortable” place.  
* **Shifting Cultivation Trends:**  
* **Rising Durian:** Durian cultivation has been increasing in recent years due to favourable market prices and significantly higher yields.  
* **Stable Mango Varieties:** Green-skin Siamese mango (Taiwanese mango) area has increased, while Chu and Cat Hoa Loc mangoes area remain relatively stable.  
* **Average Landholding Size:** Most households own around 5 *cong* (local land measurement unit, roughly equivalent to 0.5 hectares), with a few larger holdings of 10-20 *cong*.  
* **Socio-economic contexts:**  
  * **Migration patterns:**   
    * **Limited In-Migration:** Few people from other regions move to the commune for farming; most are from neighboring areas.  
    * **Out-Migration of Youth:** Young people tend to migrate to Ho Chi Minh City and industrial zones in Binh Duong for work.  
  * **Female Participation:** Women participate in farming, often assisting with tasks like harvesting and sorting, but men are typically the primary decision-makers and perform more labor-intensive tasks. Few households have women as the primary farmers. Limited female participation in mango trainings or mango-related events.  
  * **Youth Participation:** The number of farmers under 30-35 is small. They face challenges due to a lack of experience but possess physical strength and potential for adopting new technologies.  
* **Dyke System:** The commune is divided into 11 dyke zones, covering a total area of over 1491 hectares, with 888.5 hectares dedicated to fruit trees. Durian cultivation is widespread within these zones.

![][image2]

*Zoning in Binh Hang Tay with zones separated from each other by canals. Those zones with red marks have a majority of mango cultivation. A table of crop distribution in every zone and a plot map for the commune are available.*

## **3\. Cultivation Practices:**

* **Local Farming Expertise:** Farmers use traditional knowledge and independently source inputs. Decisions on what types of fertilizers and pesticides are based on experience and advice from local dealers.  
* **Labor Organizations:**   
  * Family Labor: Family members handle caretaking \- like spraying water (irrigation) on top of mango canopy after every rain to limit diseases.      
  * Hired Labor: Hired labor (mostly men) handles specific tasks. Hired labor is mostly men. Labor demand varies by season, with flowering and stages requiring more intensive work (spraying).  
  * Labor Costs: 350,000 VND/person/day. Labor shortages are leading to increased wages. There are established teams to facilitate hired labor for tasks like mango bagging, often comprising local farmers seeking additional income.  
* **Techniques:**  
  * *Spraying:* done frequently (14 times per crop cycle), including stimulating flowering and washing leaves after rains. Done more frequently in rainy seasons (14 times) compared to dry seasons (6-7 times).  
    * Mixing multiple types of pesticides is common.  
  * *Irrigation:* Using overhead sprinkler systems owned by each household.  
  * *Fertilization:* There’s a trend towards more organic methods, including reduction of chemical use, use of organic fertilizers or compost from fallen leaves and branches.  
  * *Canopy Management:* Newer orchards have lower canopies for easier management.  
* **Varieties and Intercropping:** Main mango varieties are Cat Chu and Taiwanese. Intercropping (papaya) is practiced in newly planted mango orchards.  
* **Harvest and yield:**  
* Two main harvests per year in November and February of the lunar calendar. “Mùa thuận” (Optimal season) and “mùa nghịch” (Unfavorable season), with “mùa thuận” requiring less pesticides.  
* **Harvest Timing:** Two main harvests occur annually, one optimal and one unfavorable season (November and February), with optimal season requiring less pesticides.  
* **Yield patterns:**   
  * Mango yield varies with tree age and weather conditions.  
  * 2024: quite good yield; 2025: poor yield due to erratic weather (with heavy rain causing anthracnose, disrupting flowering)

## **4\. Costs and Income:**

* **Farmers’ Income Sources:** Primarily from mango cultivation and wage labor. Some women earn additional income from water hyacinth weaving.  
  * Supplementary income also comes from intercropped plants, such as papaya.  
* **Cost factors:**  
  * Input costs \- fertilizer and pesticides; increase in pesticide prices and risks associated with fake pesticides are a big concern.  
  * Labor costs for tasks like fruit bagging, post-harvest pruning, and root tilling  
  * Electricity cost for irrigation

## **5\. Sales and Market Access:**

* **Sales channels:**  
  * **Traders**: Mainly through regular traders who come to the orchards to pack and ship the mangoes for export to China  
  * **Direct sales:** some farmers sell directly to markets, where they handle the sorting, packaging and transportation themselves  
  * **Role of the Cooperative in Sales:** Previously handled 30-40% of mango sales but this has ceased since the contract with the company ended. Farmers now sell independently.  
* **Price dynamics:** Mango prices fluctuate significantly (Cat Chu: 2024 \- 9000 VND/kg (Feb) → 26,000 VND/kg (Nov)) and vary between different varieties (April 2025: Cat Chu \- 15-16,000 VND/kg; Taiwan green: 4,000 VND/kg; Taiwan yellow: 8,000 VND/kg \- prices when sold in bulk with no sorting)  
* **Market access needs:**   
  * **Crop decision-making:** strongly influenced by Chinese market demand. Fear of market volatility discourages switching from mango alternatives like jackfruit.  
  * Main concern is securing stable and predictable market outlets.  
  * Challenges in selling to companies: supply-demand mismatch  
    * Challenges in meeting consistent, high-volume supply due to fluctuating yield

## **6\. Cooperation, Training and Information Sharing:**

* **Farmer Groups:**  
  * Voluntary groups ("tổ nghề nghiệp" / “hội quán”) exist, functioning like informal cooperatives.  
  * Community-based extension groups (10–12 members) include officials and skilled farmers who support others.  
* **Information Sharing:**  
  * Zalo is widely used for real-time updates on weather, spraying schedules, and farming tips.  
  * Farmers also access information via YouTube, training materials, and agricultural supply shops.  
* **Knowledge Exchange Dynamics:**  
  * Mixed attitudes: Some skilled farmers share openly, especially within extension groups, while others claim they are reluctant to disclose techniques.  
* **Trust and Collaboration Challenges:**  
  * Selling to companies requires collective action, but farmers report difficulties in agreeing on price, volume, and product quality.  
* **Agricultural Extension and Knowledge Sharing:**   
  * Workshops are organized with agrochemical companies and the local cooperative in the Minh Long Community Hall (now Binh Hang Tay Agricultural Service Cooperative Office).  
  * Staff from the agricultural service center offer guidance, but peer learning and knowledge sharing among experienced farmers remain key sources of information.  
* **Training gap:**  
  * Fewer mango-related trainings in recent years due to increased focus on durian cultivation.  
  * Since early 2025, only four mango training sessions have been held by the Agriculture Department.  
  * Women are rarely involved in technical training sessions.

## **7\. Technical Standards:**

* **Cultivation Practices:**  
  * Most farmers follow traditional methods without standardized protocols.  
  * There is growing awareness of the need to reduce chemical use and adopt more organic practices for better market access.  
* **Certification Efforts:**  
  * **OCOP:**  
    * Attempt at OCOP registration failed at the commune level due to food safety and traceability issues.  
    * **Barriers to OCOP:**  
      * Small producers find transport to collection points impractical.  
      * Traders offer more convenient, home-based collection.  
      * Farmers would join only if OCOP offers significantly better prices.  
  * **VietGAP and organic practices:**  
    * A prior VietGAP initiative led to record-keeping but no significant changes in practice.  
    * Most farmers use safe methods but lack VietGAP certification.   
    * Production is mostly conventional (70–80%), with some organic practices (20–30%).

## **8\. Challenges and Perspectives:**

* **Climate and Environmental Challenges:**  
  * Unpredictable weather severely affects yields, despite farmers’ experience.  
  * Pests and diseases (e.g., anthracnose/Colletotrichum) are common.  
  * Maintenance of tall, aging mango trees is difficult.  
* **Market and Production Issues:**  
  * Stable market access and fair pricing remain major concerns.  
  * Most mangoes are sold in bulk to traders; an attempt at selective grading contracts (between the cooperative and a Tien Giang company) has failed.  
* **Farmer Attitudes and Resilience:** Strong sense of resilience and commitment to mango cultivation: Farmers accept seasonal fluctuations as part of agricultural life and are generally reluctant to switch crops.  
* **Organic Farming Limitations:**  
  * Fully organic farming is difficult due to reliance on traditional methods and limitations of organic fertilizers.  
  * No dedicated market demand for certified organic mangoes from the region yet.

# **C. Coconut in Tam Ngãi Commune (Cầu Kè District, Trà Vinh)**

## **1\. History and Transition:**

* Coconut cultivation has deep roots; some gardens are 50–60 years old.  
* King oranges were once dominant but lost profitability (30,000 VND/kg around 4 years ago → under 1,000 VND/kg today).  
* Farmers switched to coconuts due to King oranges’ price drops and coconuts’ lower labor demands.  
* Coconut (for oil) prices soared in 2025 (165,000 VND in Jan → 225,000 VND in April per dozen \- 12 coconuts), driving a "coconut fever."  
* Minor trend toward Cat Chu mango and red jackfruit conversions.

## **2\. System Overview:**

* Tam Ngãi: \~705 ha of coconuts (80% of cultivated land); 1600+ households.  
* Traditional intercropping models:   
  * 2-3 layers of plants intercropped to utilize land and sun.  
  * Often coconuts \+ oranges when coconut trees are young (under 20 years old).  
* Tam Ngãi is a year-round freshwater area, but low-lying and flood-prone.

## **3\. Cultivation Practices:**

* **Low Labor Management:** Coconut care is low-labor compared to other crops.  
* **Organic Farming Shift:**   
  * The commune is oriented and supported by the Van Hung Cooperative (from Cang Long) to register a certificate for organic coconut with plan to become a source for the cooperative; targeting demanding markets such as the EU and Japan.  
  * Coconuts are considered easy to meet organic standards due to the low use of pesticides and fertilizers.  
* **Pest Management**  
  * Black-headed caterpillars are the primary concern.   
  * The District's Department of Agriculture coordinated with the Sub-Department of Crop Production and Rural Development to organize training sessions on pest control and planting area codes (5 trainings already happened in the commune in 2025, 3 of which were in Ngoc Ho hamlet)  
  * **Pesticide poisoning:** There have been cases of farmers improperly using powder pesticides, causing poisoning of coconut trees, but it’s rare.  
* **Supplementary irrigation:** While coconuts didn’t traditionally need irrigation, many farmers now supplement water during dry seasons to prevent fruit shrinkage.

* **Harvest and yield:**

  * **Harvest Frequency:** Coconuts are usually harvested once or twice a month. Wax coconuts are harvested every two weeks, about one bunch/tree each time.  
  * **Yields:** Oil coconuts (namely dry coconut) yield \~₫100 million/ha/year (₫22 million/cong/year). Wax coconuts fetch up to ₫90,000 each fruit—Ms. Ngan earned over ₫30 million from a single harvest with 390/430 fruits being wax coconuts.

## **4\. Costs and Income:**

* **Low input costs:** Fertilizer is the main expense (about 2,600,000 VND/cong/year), and very little pesticide cost.  
* **Strong current income:** Current high coconut prices provide a steady income. The orientation towards organic coconuts promises to further increase product value and expand the market.

## **5\. Sales and Market Access:**

* **Current channels:** Coconuts are usually sold directly locally or through traders \- traders come to harvest at the gardens.  
* **Export preparation:** The commune finished dossiers to obtain a planting area code for coconuts, paving the way for export to the Chinese market. Organic certification paperwork is also being prepared to access demanding markets such as the EU and Japan.  
* **Cooperative’s Role:** The Van Hung Cooperative in Cang Long plays an important role in supporting costs and techniques for the Tam Ngãi commune to build an organic coconut growing area, aiming to supply raw materials for the Cooperative's exports.

## **6\. Cooperation, Training and Information Sharing:**

* **Effective information network**: the cadres have Zalo groups for each hamlet and commune to announce salinity levels, sluice gate opening and closing schedules, and share agricultural information.  
* **Farmer networks**: Farmers also form their own informal groups to exchange experiences in coconut cultivation. 

(*quite a number of groups, to be further explored)*

* **Pest and technical training:** The District's Department of Agriculture, with the support of the Sub-Department of Crop Production and Rural Development, regularly organizes training sessions on pest control (especially the black-headed caterpillar) and guidance on planting area codes. Training sessions are organized according to the needs of the farmers.

## **7\. Challenges and Perspectives:**

* **Flooding risks**: The low-lying terrain makes Tam Ngãi prone to flooding, affecting agricultural production.  
* **Organic transition challenges:** The transition to organic farming may face initial technical difficulties, and there is no significant price difference compared to regular coconuts yet. However, this is a sustainable direction with the potential for future value growth.  
* **Youth involvement**: There are few full-time young farmers, but those involved are enthusiastic and eager to learn. Access to capital/land remains a barrier.  
* **Overall prospects:** With the current high price of coconuts, support from the Cooperative, and the orientation towards developing organic coconuts, the coconut growing industry in Tam Ngãi has positive prospects, promising stable income and improved livelihoods for the people.

# **D. Rice-Shrimp in Nam Yên Commune (An Biên District, Kien Giang)** (To be completed)

## **1\. History and Transition:**

* Nam Yen is covered by only rice-shrimp farming areas, with no double-rice. Transitioning to rice-shrimp  requires unanimous agreement from all farmers due to water flows.  
* In Nam Yen, the transition from double-rice farming to rice-shrimp started from 2017-2018 2019-2020, started in Bào Trâm in Thu Ba canal, followed by ing previous transitions from neighboring areas (like Hai Xáng Cooperative in Kênh Thứ Hai canal, which transitioned in around 20187). This transition was pushed forward by the government, but initially faced strong resistance from the 2-rice farmers. Directors of cooperatives had to use different methods (formal and informal) to convince farmers to transition   
* In next-door areas like Thị trấn Kênh Thứ Ba where double-rice is still practiced, there have been talks about transitioning to rice-shrimp but the transition has not occurred due to the lack of agreement from some the majority of farmers \- The difficulties were reasoned around: small landholding making it hard to convert to shrimp pond (about 20% of land will be reduced to make pond from the rice land), and expectation to gain benefit from land price increase in the area \- probably from any residential area/industry or buildings.  
* In the meantime, sSome areas in An Bien district are covered under the 1 million hectare HQLE project. 

## **2\. System Overview:**

* Rice-shrimp rotation: rice and shrimp are rotated, with 1 rice and 1 shrimp season every year. Shrimp is also raised together with crabs.  
* **Land holding:** land holding ranges from 2 công (1 công \= 1296 m2) to more than 10 công. Those with multiple small-sized plots may rent out to others and rent in to cultivate to ensure land concentration, especially when rice-shrimp farming requires bigger plots of land to reserve spaces to dig ponds and build banks. →  Limitations in transitioning to rice-shrimp in areas where farmers mainly own small plots of land (like in TT. Kênh Thứ Ba, as reported by Mr. TT Kenh T3Sam Ret)  
*  **Socio-economic contexts:**  
  * **Ethnic Minorities:** A number of Khmer people reside in the area, engaging in both rice and rice-shrimp farming depending on the area.  
  * **Youth Participation:** Very few young farmers due to outmigration. Those who stay often inherit land to cultivate.  
  * **Female Participation:** Female participation in technical training or meetings is limited. Women also participate in some processes of farming but participation is limited compared to men. Further exploration is required.

## **3\. Cultivation Practices:**

* Rice-shrimp farming:  
  * Rice: mainly ST24 or ST25 varieties, with some households growing 2517 variety \- all salt-tolerant and high-yielding. ST24 and ST25 are reported to be disease-resistant.  
    * Seeds sown in August (lunar calendar) and rice harvested around Lunar Tết  
    * Rice fields are flooded with rainwater and canal water once salinity drops.  
    * Waste from shrimp farming is used as natural fertilizer for rice fields which is believed by farmers as the reason for the rice plantation having less disease compared to 2-rice model. Fertilizers: organic and chemical?   
    * Alternate Wetting and Drying is also practiced from time to time, but not by all. The application of AWD in Bao Tram cooperative area has been a processed of learning by doing (reported by Mr. Bao Tram cooperative).  
  * Shrimp \- also crabs:  
    * Shrimp seedlings are stocked in 2-3 batches per season, density is adjusted based on pond conditions and feed availability, often 1.5 months apart.  
      * Density is not fixed, depending on farmers and their experience. Mr bao tram CooperativeKhai, for example, stocks 600 seedlings (Post larvae 12\) per công for the first batch, and 300-500 more in the second batch.  
      * Shrimp feeds are natural feeds \- ngao trâu (trâu clams?) and ốc (snails) \- bought or collected by farmers (the process of snail collection requires difficult work \- diving under the water \- some are making income from collecting them in the water ways and sell it back to fellow farmers)  
    * Pond preparation before stocking: drying, liming (with vôi) and creating bait (“tạo mồi”) before stocking  
    * Harvesting of shrimp and crabs: aroundevery 3 months starting from March/April lunar month), multiple times during the cycle. Harvesting is done using “vó”nets.  
      * Continuous harvesting: some farmers harvest daily or regularly, as long as the shrimp or crabs are available and moving.  
      * Waiting for tides \- moon influence (for shrimp): in certain cases, farmers might wait for the right water movement or tides \- such as around the full moon (day 15\) and new moon (day 30\) when shrimp activity is higher and they are easier to catch.   
* Double rice:  
  * Varieties: mainly Đài Thơm 8, with OM 5451 sometimes used as an alternative.  
  * 2 rice crops per year:   
    * Summer-Autumn: sown in May (lunar calendar), harvested in lunar August. Around 105 days.  
    * Winter-Spring: sown around lunar November, harvested around Tết. Around 97 days.  
    * From post-Tết until lunar May: land is left uncultivated for plowing and exposing. This is because saline water intrusion makes irrigation impossible. Farmers must wait for rainy season to start to resume rice farming.   
    * Water used is either river water (whenith low salinity) or rainwater.  
    * Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are used.  
* Cultivation standards:  
  * Double-rice: no standard  
  * Rice-shrimp: not 100% organic but organic-oriented. Farmers use natural feeds and organic fertilizers.  
    * For contract farming: Farmers under contract farming follow rice cultivation practices instructed by companies, such as seed selection and spraying techniques in the case of those signing contract with Mr. Hồ Quang Cua.   
    * For organic farming: no incentives for farmers to follow organic rice farming methods due to the little difference in prices at this moment. Mr. Bao tram CooperativeKhai remarked that farmers would only follow organic farming if there was a 3000-5000 VND/kg difference with non-organic rice.

## **4\. Costs and Income:**

* Farmers’ income sources: primarily from rice-shrimp farming (rice, shrimp, crabs), some work as hired labor for other farmers and/or in the nearby port. The later group is often link with Khmer community and/or with smaller landholding. Income from shrimp and crabs  is often higher than from rice.  
  * At the time of interview (May 2025), shrimp and crab prices are good and yield is high (Shrimp: average 300,000 VND/kg, Crabs: 300-500,000 VND/kg \- an increase of 20-30,000 VND/kg compared to 2024 \- mainly from the new method of providing oxygen to the shrimp to keep it alive longer rather than original way of keeping the freshy caught shrimp with ice). Average income of 7-8 million VND/công.  
    * Farmers are rotating family members to watch shrimp ponds to prevent thieves due to the high prices.  
  * Rice: double-rice (without contract farming): 3,000 VND/kg (Mr. TT Thu baSầm Rết); rice-shrimp (under contract farming with Ho Quang Cua company): 11,000-13,500 VND/kg   
  * Shrimp yields fluctuate greatly depending on the year. Farmers attribute this to both techniques and luck   
* Costs:  
  * Rice-shrimp farmers report lower costs of fertilizers and pesticides.   
  * Farmers under the 1 million hectare HQLE rice project also get government support for fertilizer and pesticide costs (not in Nam Yen).  
  * Farmers also report a significant rise in fertilizer prices despite the stability of rice price.

## **5\. Sales and Market Access:**

* **Contract farming for rice-shrimp farming:**   
  * Contracts signed with cooperatives (Hai Xáng Cooperative and Bào Trâm Cooperative) for rice.   
    * Hai Xáng Cooperative: contract with Vạn Trường Thịnh  
    * Bào Trâm Cooperative: contract with Hồ Quang Trí  
    * Prices higher than market prices by 1000-2000 VND/kg  
    * Previous contracts: Mr. Bao tram cooperative Khai reported facing issues with a company (Quốc Tế Gia) because of low-quality seeds.  
    * Some farmers are hesitant to join cooperatives because of price fluctuation  
  * No contract farming for shrimp. Farmers rely on local traders.  
* **Double-rice farming:**   
  * No contract farming (reported by Mr. TT thu baSam Ret)  
  * Reasons for the lack of contract farming (as reported by Mr. TT thu baMr. Sam Ret)  
    * Small-scale and fragmented farming  
    * Unstable market prices: even with a contract, buyers may still offer lower prices when the market drops  
    * More freedom and flexibility to choose and change fertilizers, pesticides and types of seeds. No rigid protocol.  
    *  Cost-efficiency: flexibility to switch products if one doesn’t work means better management of costs.

## **6\. Cooperation, Training and Information Sharing:**

* **Informal, family-based and peer-to-peer learning:**  
  * Most farmers initiallyinitiaully learn rice or shrimp cultivation from parents, siblings, and neighbors.  
  * Farmers also rely on nearby relatives, friends or experienced locals to share farming methods and advice.  
  * Online platforms: YouTube is also used when farmers need to look up pest identification and farming techniques, especially for those who are younger or more tech-savvy.  
* **Input Dealers:** Farmers rely heavily on local input dealers like Trung Hiếu and Huỳnh Thắng in providing them with technical advice and support, such as what fertilizers of what pesticides or nutrients to use when there’s disease   
* **Training and capacity building:**  
  * Occasional workshops are offered by companies or local authorities, sometimes hosted by cooperatives.   
  * **Agricultural extension center** provides training and technical guidance, particularly during transitions from double-rice to rice-shrimp and AWD techniques.  
  * Low participation in formal training, especially when farmers feel they already know the techniques or find it inconvenient. 

## **7\. Challenges and Perspectives:**

* **Market and prices**: Stable market access and fair pricing remain a big issue, especially for shrimp and rice producers who are not in contract farming.   
  * The small difference between non-organic and organic rice prices also disincentivizes farmers from cultivating organic rice.  
* Rice-shrimp farmers mostly consider transitioning to be a good decision, especially now when the prices and yields of shrimp and crabs are high. However, yield and price fluctuation remain a big problem.  
* **Challenges in transitioning to rice-shrimp** in rice monoculture areas due to: small-scale and fragmented cultivation which results in loss of land when digging ponds for shrimp; inadequate irrigation infrastructure; conflict with other land uses and neigbors and lack of collective agreement among them.t  
* **Spiritual beliefs in shrimp farming**, such as checking the date for stocking shrimp, avoiding going to the pond after going to a funeral, or avoidin grilling home-grown shrimp, etc. may be an issue for further exploration to see how they influence farmers’ cultivation practices (as well as potential gender issue related to shrimp farming).
