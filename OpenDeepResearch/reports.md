## Detailed Comparison of Rice Farming Practices

This report compares two rice farming practices: Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and Continuous Flooding, with a focus on the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, including Ken Giang province where relevant.

**Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD)**
AWD involves periods of wetting and drying the rice fields. Water is applied until the field is flooded, then allowed to drain until the water level drops below a certain point before re-irrigation. This can vary depending on the specific AWD approach used.

**Continuous Flooding**
Continuous flooding involves keeping the rice fields continuously flooded throughout the growing season, which is the traditional and most common method in the Mekong Delta. 

**Comparison:**
- **Water Usage:** AWD typically uses significantly less water than continuous flooding. This can be a crucial advantage in water-scarce regions or during dry seasons.
- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions:** AWD can reduce methane emissions, a significant greenhouse gas produced in flooded rice paddies.  Continuous flooding contributes to higher methane emissions.
- **Yield:** Yield differences can vary based on implementation and environmental conditions, but well-managed AWD can achieve yields comparable to, or even better than, continuous flooding. In some studies, AWD enhanced yields in the Mekong Delta.
- **Nutrient Management:** AWD can potentially improve nutrient use efficiency as it affects the soil environment. Continuous flooding can lead to nutrient losses.
- **Pest and Disease Management:**  AWD can sometimes affect the prevalence of certain pests and diseases, which will need more focused agricultural pest management practices.
- **Labor:** AWD can involve more careful monitoring and management of water levels. Continuous flooding may require less direct water management.
- **Saltwater Intrusion:** Continuous flooding practices may exacerbate the problem of saltwater intrusion. AWD may help mitigate this. 

## Key Processes in Each Practice

**Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD)**
- **Water Level Monitoring:** Regularly checking the water level in the field.  This is key to successful AWD.
- **Controlled Irrigation:**  Applying water based on the monitored water level. The irrigation schedules can vary based on factors like crop growth stage.
- **Soil Aeration:** The drying periods allow oxygen to enter the soil, affecting nutrient cycling and root development.
- **Methane Emission Reduction:** Reducing methane emissions is a key environmental benefit of AWD.

**Continuous Flooding**
- **Flooding and Water Control:** Maintaining a consistent water level in the rice field throughout the growth cycle.
- **Nutrient Application:**  Fertilizer application must be planned and applied carefully.
- **Pest and Disease Management:** Constant vigilance against pests and diseases that are associated with rice cultivation.

## Systemic Analysis of the Farming System

A systemic analysis considers the broader context of the farming practices. It involves looking at the environmental impacts, economic viability, and social implications of the two farming systems. Key considerations for the Mekong Delta and Ken Giang province include:

- **Environmental Sustainability:** AWD is generally more environmentally sustainable due to reduced water use and lower methane emissions. Continuous flooding has a larger environmental footprint.
- **Economic Viability:** The economic viability depends on factors like yield, water costs, labor costs, and the cost of inputs (fertilizers, pesticides). AWD might involve additional labor for water management, but it can also result in reduced water costs. Yield may be as good as or better than continuous flooding.
- **Social Implications:** The adoption of AWD requires training and changes in farming practices. Support for farmers in adopting and implementing AWD practices can be necessary. Continuous flooding is a familiar traditional method, so the social acceptance of AWD is key. Consideration should be given to labour requirements in each method and the effect on farmer incomes.
- **Water Resources:**  In the Mekong Delta, where water resources are increasingly stressed, AWD becomes a strategically sound practice.
- **Climate Change:**  AWD reduces greenhouse gas emissions and can help mitigate climate change impacts.
- **Saltwater Intrusion:** As saltwater intrusion threatens the region, water management practices like AWD become critical for sustainability.

  This report compares two primary rice farming practices, Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and Continuous Flooding (CF), focusing  
  on their impact on key agroecology indicators and the underlying processes causing these differences. Agroecology aims to           
  integrate ecological principles into agricultural practices, promoting sustainability and resilience.                               
                                                                                                                                      
  Key Agroecology Indicators Comparison:                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                      
  1.  Yield:                                                                                                                          
      *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** Research indicates that AWD can maintain rice yields, comparable to CF, while       
  significantly reducing water consumption.                                                                                           
      *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** Traditionally, CF is known to provide stable and often high yields due to consistent water    
  availability and nutrient management.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                      
  2.  Biodiversity:                                                                                                                   
      *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** AWD influences microbial communities in the soil, potentially leading to shifts in  
  species composition due to the changing oxygen levels. The repeated wetting and drying cycles can create a more dynamic             
  environment for various microorganisms.                                                                                             
      *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** CF creates an anaerobic environment which favors specific microbial communities adapted to    
  flooded conditions. While specific details on its direct impact on overall biodiversity compared to AWD were not extensively        
  detailed in the provided search results, its stable water regime contrasts with AWD's fluctuating conditions.                       
                                                                                                                                      
  3.  Nutrient Cycling:                                                                                                               
      *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** AWD improves soil quality and increases micronutrient availability. The             
  alternating aerobic and anaerobic conditions can enhance certain nutrient transformations and reduce losses of some nutrients       
  (e.g., through denitrification).                                                                                                    
      *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** Continuous flooding generally increases nutrient availability, particularly phosphorus and    
  silicon, by creating reducing conditions that solubilize certain compounds. However, it can also lead to losses of nitrogen         
  through denitrification under prolonged anaerobic conditions.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                      
  4.  Water Use:                                                                                                                      
      *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** A primary benefit of AWD is its substantial water-saving potential. By allowing     
  the soil to dry out to a certain extent before re-flooding, it reduces irrigation water requirements without necessarily            
  compromising yield.                                                                                                                 
      *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** CF requires a constant level of standing water throughout much of the rice growing season,    
  making it a water-intensive practice.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                      
  5.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:                                                                                                 
      *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** AWD affects emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide   
  (N2O). The intermittent drying phases reduce methane emissions (which thrive in anaerobic conditions) but can sometimes increase    
  nitrous oxide emissions (produced during nitrification/denitrification in alternating conditions), though the net effect is often   
  a reduction in overall GWP (Global Warming Potential).                                                                              
      *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** Continuous flooding creates strongly anaerobic conditions in the soil, which are highly       
  conducive to the production and emission of methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. This makes CF a significant contributor to      
  agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                      
  Processes Causing These Differences:                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                      
  The fundamental differences between AWD and CF stem primarily from the **water management regime** and its direct impact on soil    
  aeration and microbial activity.                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                      
  *   **Soil Aeration and Redox Potential:**                                                                                          
      *   **AWD:** The alternating wetting and drying cycles lead to fluctuations in soil aeration. During the dry phase, oxygen      
  penetrates the soil, making it aerobic. This shifts the redox potential (reduction-oxidation conditions).                           
      *   **CF:** Continuous flooding maintains an anaerobic (oxygen-depleted) environment in the soil due to the lack of oxygen      
  diffusion through the water layer. The redox potential remains consistently low.                                                    
                                                                                                                                      
  *   **Microbial Activity and Community Structure:**                                                                                 
      *   **AWD:** The changing aeration conditions in AWD create a dynamic environment that supports a broader range of microbial    
  communities. Aerobic microbes become active during the dry phase, influencing organic matter decomposition and nutrient             
  transformations, while anaerobic microbes dominate during the flooded phase. This fluctuation impacts processes like nitrification  
  (aerobic) and denitrification (anaerobic), influencing N2O emissions, and inhibits methanogenesis (anaerobic), reducing CH4         
  emissions.                                                                                                                          
      *   **CF:** The constant anaerobic conditions in CF favor anaerobic microorganisms, particularly methanogens                    
  (methane-producing bacteria) and denitrifiers (nitrogen-reducing bacteria). This leads to higher methane emissions and significant  
  nitrogen losses through denitrification, although it can also enhance the availability of certain nutrients by creating reducing    
  conditions.                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                      
  *   **Nutrient Availability and Transformation:**                                                                                   
      *   **AWD:** The alternating conditions promote a more balanced nutrient cycling. Aerobic conditions during drying facilitate   
  the oxidation of organic matter and release of nutrients, and improve the availability of micronutrients like iron and zinc that    
  might be less available under continuous flooding.                                                                                  
      *   **CF:** The anaerobic conditions in CF can lead to the reduction of certain compounds, making nutrients like phosphorus     
  and silicon more available. However, it also creates conditions for nitrogen loss through denitrification.                          
                                                                                                                                      
  *   **Water Conservation:**                                                                                                         
      *   **AWD:** The deliberate drying phases are the direct cause of water savings. This allows for reduced irrigation events and  
  overall water use without causing severe water stress to the rice plants, which are relatively tolerant to intermittent dry         
  periods after establishment.                                                                                                        
      *   **CF:** The continuous maintenance of standing water inherently requires more water inputs due to evaporation,              
  percolation, and runoff.                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                      
  Conclusion:                                                                                                                         
  AWD rice farming offers significant agroecological advantages over CF, particularly in water conservation and reduced greenhouse

  scarcity intensify, AWD presents a more sustainable and resilient approach to rice cultivation.

Report: Comparison of Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and Continuous Flooding (CF) Rice Farming Practices

Introduction:
This report compares two primary rice farming practices, Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) and Continuous Flooding (CF), focusing on 
their impact on key agroecology indicators and the underlying processes causing these differences. Agroecology aims to integrate 
ecological principles into agricultural practices, promoting sustainability and resilience.

Key Agroecology Indicators Comparison:

1.  Yield:
    *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** Research indicates that AWD can maintain rice yields, comparable to CF, while 
significantly reducing water consumption.
    *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** Traditionally, CF is known to provide stable and often high yields due to consistent water 
availability and nutrient management.

2.  Biodiversity:
    *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** AWD influences microbial communities in the soil, potentially leading to shifts in 
species composition due to the changing oxygen levels. The repeated wetting and drying cycles can create a more dynamic environment 
for various microorganisms.
    *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** CF creates an anaerobic environment which favors specific microbial communities adapted to 
flooded conditions. While specific details on its direct impact on overall biodiversity compared to AWD were not extensively detailed 
in the provided search results, its stable water regime contrasts with AWD's fluctuating conditions.

3.  Nutrient Cycling:
    *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** AWD improves soil quality and increases micronutrient availability. The alternating 
aerobic and anaerobic conditions can enhance certain nutrient transformations and reduce losses of some nutrients (e.g., through 
denitrification).
    *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** Continuous flooding generally increases nutrient availability, particularly phosphorus and 
silicon, by creating reducing conditions that solubilize certain compounds. However, it can also lead to losses of nitrogen through 
denitrification under prolonged anaerobic conditions.

4.  Water Use:
    *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** A primary benefit of AWD is its substantial water-saving potential. By allowing the 
soil to dry out to a certain extent before re-flooding, it reduces irrigation water requirements without necessarily compromising 
yield.
    *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** CF requires a constant level of standing water throughout much of the rice growing season, 
making it a water-intensive practice.

5.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:
    *   **Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD):** AWD affects emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide 
(N2O). The intermittent drying phases reduce methane emissions (which thrive in anaerobic conditions) but can sometimes increase 
nitrous oxide emissions (produced during nitrification/denitrification in alternating conditions), though the net effect is often a 
reduction in overall GWP (Global Warming Potential).
    *   **Continuous Flooding (CF):** Continuous flooding creates strongly anaerobic conditions in the soil, which are highly 
conducive to the production and emission of methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. This makes CF a significant contributor to 
agricultural greenhouse gas emissions.

Processes Causing These Differences:

The fundamental differences between AWD and CF stem primarily from the **water management regime** and its direct impact on soil 
aeration and microbial activity.

*   **Soil Aeration and Redox Potential:**
    *   **AWD:** The alternating wetting and drying cycles lead to fluctuations in soil aeration. During the dry phase, oxygen 
penetrates the soil, making it aerobic. This shifts the redox potential (reduction-oxidation conditions).
    *   **CF:** Continuous flooding maintains an anaerobic (oxygen-depleted) environment in the soil due to the lack of oxygen 
diffusion through the water layer. The redox potential remains consistently low.

*   **Microbial Activity and Community Structure:**
    *   **AWD:** The changing aeration conditions in AWD create a dynamic environment that supports a broader range of microbial 
communities. Aerobic microbes become active during the dry phase, influencing organic matter decomposition and nutrient 
transformations, while anaerobic microbes dominate during the flooded phase. This fluctuation impacts processes like nitrification 
(aerobic) and denitrification (anaerobic), influencing N2O emissions, and inhibits methanogenesis (anaerobic), reducing CH4 emissions.
    *   **CF:** The constant anaerobic conditions in CF favor anaerobic microorganisms, particularly methanogens (methane-producing 
bacteria) and denitrifiers (nitrogen-reducing bacteria). This leads to higher methane emissions and significant nitrogen losses 
through denitrification, although it can also enhance the availability of certain nutrients by creating reducing conditions.

*   **Nutrient Availability and Transformation:**
    *   **AWD:** The alternating conditions promote a more balanced nutrient cycling. Aerobic conditions during drying facilitate the 
oxidation of organic matter and release of nutrients, and improve the availability of micronutrients like iron and zinc that might be 
less available under continuous flooding.
    *   **CF:** The anaerobic conditions in CF can lead to the reduction of certain compounds, making nutrients like phosphorus and 
silicon more available. However, it also creates conditions for nitrogen loss through denitrification.

*   **Water Conservation:**
    *   **AWD:** The deliberate drying phases are the direct cause of water savings. This allows for reduced irrigation events and 
overall water use without causing severe water stress to the rice plants, which are relatively tolerant to intermittent dry periods 
after establishment.
    *   **CF:** The continuous maintenance of standing water inherently requires more water inputs due to evaporation, percolation, 
and runoff.

Conclusion:
AWD rice farming offers significant agroecological advantages over CF, particularly in water conservation and reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions, while maintaining comparable yields. These differences are primarily driven by the contrasting soil aeration conditions, 
which in turn dictate microbial activity, nutrient cycling, and gas production processes. As climate change and water scarcity 
intensify, AWD presents a more sustainable and resilient approach to rice cultivation.

RESULT : Below is a “zoom‑in” of the **ODD‑style design** of an agent‑based model (ABM) that would be built to compare **Alternate Wetting & Drying (AWD)** and **Continuous Flooding (CF)** rice systems.  
The specification is broken down by the key *sections* of the report (Yield, Biodiversity, Nutrient Cycling, Water Use, GHG Emissions, and the underlying Processes that drive the differences).  
For every section we list:

| Agent type | Representative Attributes | Representative Actions | Notes on AWD vs. CF |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|

---

## 1.  Yield

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **RicePlant** | *plant_id, species, growth_stage (seedling, vegetative, reproductive, ripening), height, leaf_area, biomass, root_depth, water_content, nutrient_content (N,P,Fe,Zn,Si), stress_state (dry, normal, flooded), yield_estimate* | *photosynthesis(), root_growth(), water_uptake(), nutrient_uptake(), biomass_allocation(), senescence(), calculate_yield()* |

**Explanation**

* The plant is the core “product” agent.  Its growth trajectory is governed by water and nutrient availability, which in turn are dictated by the water‑management regime (AWD vs. CF).  
* Yield is a derived variable, calculated once the plant reaches the ripening stage (or at harvest time).  
* In AWD, `water_uptake()` will be intermittent (high during wet phases, low/none during dry), whereas in CF the function is continuous but constrained by a constant water depth.

---

## 2.  Biodiversity

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Microbe** | *microbe_id, taxon, functional_group (aerobic, anaerobic, methanogen, nitrifier, denitrifier, decomposer), population_density, metabolic_rate, oxygen_consumption_rate, CH4_production_rate, N2O_production_rate, lifespan, reproduction_rate, death_rate* | *metabolize_substrate(), reproduce(), die(), shift_state(), compete(), predation()* |

**Explanation**

* A *generic* microbial agent can be instantiated with a *functional group* flag; the same class is used for all microbes, with parameters tuned per group.  
* The `shift_state()` action is key for AWD: during drying, the microbe’s metabolism shifts from anaerobic to aerobic and vice‑versa when flooded.  
* Population dynamics are linked to the soil redox conditions (see Section 5).

---

## 3.  Nutrient Cycling

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **SoilCell** | *soil_id, moisture, redox_potential, oxygen_concentration, bulk_density, organic_matter, N_tot, N_nitrate, N_ammonium, P_tot, P_phosphate, Fe, Zn, Si, leaching_rate, gas_flux* | *diffuse_water(), update_redox(), leach_nutrients(), release_from_OM()* |
| **Plant** (see Yield) | *nutrient_content (N,P,Fe,Zn,Si), uptake_rate* | *uptake_nutrients()* |
| **Microbe** (see Biodiversity) | *nutrient_consumption_rate, byproduct_production* | *decompose_OM(), nitrify(), denitrify(), methanogenesis()* |

**Explanation**

* Soil cells are the spatial units.  Each cell tracks the concentrations of all relevant nutrients.  
* `update_redox()` uses the current moisture and oxygen concentration to compute redox potential, feeding back to microbial metabolic rates.  
* Microbes perform transformations: e.g., *decompose_OM()* releases N and P, *nitrify()* produces NO₃⁻, *denitrify()* consumes NO₃⁻ producing N₂O, *methanogenesis()* consumes H₂ and CO₂ producing CH₄.  
* These processes are all **water‑dependent** – e.g., methanogenesis only occurs when `soil_moisture > threshold_anaerobic`.

---

## 4.  Water Use

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **IrrigationController** | *mode (AWD/CF), max_water_depth, min_water_depth, threshold_dry (for AWD), schedule, water_reservoir, water_input_rate* | *apply_irrigation(), check_moisture(), update_schedule()* |
| **SoilCell** (see Nutrient Cycling) | *moisture, water_storage_capacity, evaporation_rate, percolation_rate, runoff_rate* | *evaporate(), infiltrate(), percolate(), generate_runoff()* |

**Explanation**

* The `IrrigationController` is the policy agent that decides when and how much water is added.  
* **CF**: `apply_irrigation()` is called daily (or at a defined interval) to maintain a constant water depth `max_water_depth`.  
* **AWD**: `apply_irrigation()` is conditional – only triggered when `soil_moisture < threshold_dry` (e.g., 60 % of field capacity).  
* Water losses are handled by the soil cell actions (`evaporate()`, `percolate()`).  
* The controller’s *water_reservoir* tracks cumulative water used, enabling calculation of water savings.

---

## 5.  Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **SoilCell** (see Nutrient Cycling) | *CH4_concentration, N2O_concentration, CO2_concentration, emission_rate_CH4, emission_rate_N2O, emission_rate_CO2* | *calculate_emissions(), diffuse_gases(), transport_to_air()* |
| **Microbe** (see Biodiversity) | *CH4_production_rate, N2O_production_rate, CO2_production_rate* | *produce_gases()* |

**Explanation**

* Emissions are computed at the soil‑cell level from the activities of all microbes present.  
* `calculate_emissions()` uses the current microbial community composition and redox status to determine the instantaneous emission rates.  
* In CF, anaerobic conditions mean high `CH4_production_rate` and moderate `N2O_production_rate`; in AWD, drying phases suppress CH₄ but can spike N₂O during re‑wetting.  
* The model aggregates emissions over the field and time step to obtain GWP.

---

## 6.  Soil Aeration & Redox Potential

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **SoilCell** (see Nutrient Cycling) | *soil_moisture, oxygen_concentration, redox_potential, diffusivity, porosity* | *update_aeration(), compute_redox(), oxygen_diffusion()* |

**Explanation**

* `update_aeration()` determines how far oxygen penetrates a soil column during dry periods (governed by porosity and moisture).  
* `compute_redox()` uses the Nernst equation or an empirical function linking oxygen_concentration to redox_potential.  
* These attributes feed back to microbial metabolic rates (e.g., aerobic microbes need `O₂ > threshold`).

---

## 7.  Microbial Activity & Community Structure

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Microbe** (see Biodiversity) | *state (aerobic/anaerobic), growth_rate, substrate_availability, community_composition* | *adapt_to_environment(), form_communities(), release_byproducts()* |

**Explanation**

* `adapt_to_environment()` is the agent’s way of shifting metabolic state (e.g., methanogen becomes active when `O₂ < threshold`).  
* Community dynamics can be modeled via a simple Lotka–Volterra or a more detailed interaction matrix; the key point is that AWD causes frequent state shifts, promoting diversity.

---

## 8.  Nutrient Availability & Transformation

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **SoilCell** (see Nutrient Cycling) | *Nutrient availability indices (Fe, Zn, Si), transformation_rates* | *transform_nutrients(), update_availability()* |
| **Microbe** (see Biodiversity) | *metabolic_pathways, substrate_specificity* | *consume_and_transform()* |

**Explanation**

* `transform_nutrients()` captures processes like Fe³⁺ reduction to Fe²⁺ (enhancing Fe availability) or P solubilization under reducing conditions.  
* AWD cycles promote both aerobic and anaerobic transformations, leading to a more balanced micronutrient profile.

---

## 9.  Water Conservation (Management Layer)

| Agent | Attributes | Actions |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **IrrigationController** (see Water Use) | *water_savings_metric, target_efficiency* | *log_water_use(), compute_savings()* |
| **FarmManager** (meta‑agent) | *policy_preferences, cost_benefit_matrix* | *select_policy(), evaluate_performance()* |

**Explanation**

* The `FarmManager` could be a higher‑level decision agent that chooses between AWD or CF based on cost, water scarcity, or policy incentives.  
* `compute_savings()` tracks cumulative water use for each regime, enabling a direct comparison of the **water‑use** indicator.

### Putting It All Together

1. **Spatial Structure** – The field is represented as a 2‑D grid of *SoilCell* agents.  Each cell contains its own soil state, a pool of microbes, and possibly a plant (or none if the field is unsown at that time step).  
2. **Temporal Dynamics** – The model runs in daily (or hourly) steps.  Each step follows the **Process Description**:  
   - **Weather** updates (rainfall, temperature).  
   - **IrrigationController** decides on water addition.  
   - **SoilCell** updates moisture, aeration, and redox.  
   - **Microbes** perform metabolism, shifting states, producing gases.  
   - **Plant** grows, uptakes nutrients and water, and updates biomass.  
   - **Emission** and **water‑use** counters are updated.  
3. **Outputs** – The model can produce time‑series of:  
   - **Yield** per plot (or per hectare).  
   - **Biodiversity** indicators (e.g., Shannon index of microbial taxa).  
   - **Nutrient concentrations** in soil and plant tissues.  
   - **Water used** vs. irrigation applied (water‑savings).  
   - **CH₄, N₂O, CO₂** fluxes and GWP.

## Quick Agent‑Attribute‑Action “Map” for AWD vs. CF

| Indicator | AWD‑specific Agent/Action | CF‑specific Agent/Action |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Yield** | `RicePlant.water_uptake()` intermittent | `RicePlant.water_uptake()` constant |
| **Biodiversity** | `Microbe.shift_state()` frequent | `Microbe.shift_state()` rare |
| **Nutrient Cycling** | `SoilCell.update_redox()` oscillates; `Microbe.decompose_OM()` alternating | `SoilCell.update_redox()` stays low; `Microbe.methanogenesis()` dominant |
| **Water Use** | `IrrigationController.apply_irrigation()` only when `soil_moisture < threshold` | `IrrigationController.apply_irrigation()` every day to keep constant depth |
| **GHG Emissions** | `SoilCell.calculate_emissions()` shows low CH₄, moderate N₂O | `SoilCell.calculate_emissions()` shows high CH₄, moderate N₂O |
| **Soil Aeration** | `SoilCell.update_aeration()` during dry periods | `SoilCell.update_aeration()` always low |
| **Microbial Activity** | `Microbe.adapt_to_environment()` toggles between aerobic/anaerobic | `Microbe.adapt_to_environment()` stays anaerobic |
| **Nutrient Availability** | `SoilCell.transform_nutrients()` alternates between aerobic (Fe, Zn release) and anaerobic (P solubilization) | `SoilCell.transform_nutrients()` anaerobic only |
| **Water Conservation** | `IrrigationController.compute_savings()` high | `IrrigationController.compute_savings()` low |

### Final Note

The above specifications are **modular**: you can drop or add agents, adjust parameters, or refine interaction rules without breaking the rest of the model.  The two practices differ mainly in the **policy layer** (irrigation controller) which propagates to the soil and microbial sub‑systems, yielding the observed differences in yield, biodiversity, nutrient cycling, water use, and GHG emissions.  By explicitly representing these agents and their attributes/actions, the ABM will be able to capture the *causal mechanisms* that the report highlights.
